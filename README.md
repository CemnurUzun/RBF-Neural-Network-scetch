# RBF-Neural-Network-sketch
 Rbf study
This study was made to understand and apply the rbf layer basics.

In the study, I used the rbf structure that I downloaded from the git address below.

https://github.com/PetraVidnerova/rbf_keras

I used mushroom classification, wine classification and shopper intention datasets.

The work is not completed and there are deficiencies, inconsistencies in accuracy values will be addressed.

Clean and commented version will be updated and the code will be changed.
